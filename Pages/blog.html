			<h1 style="text-align: center;">Technology and it’s growth</h1>
			<br> As the digital world becomes much more widely spread, the tech sector would have the most growth potential in the future. Even someone with minimal experience in the field will recognize the enormous growth potential in the software development and technology analysis industry.<br> Technology is a part of our lives in more ways than ever before, and this includes both in the workplace and in our personal lives. It's unusual that someone is unplugged in today's world, even if that person doesn't own a phone, tablet, or computer. More people now use the internet than ever before, especially because it is available globally. Therefore, it is a fool's errand to assume that technology is only here for a short period of time. And, even more critically, to keep pushing innovation forward from one day to the next. While the technology sector offers massive investment opportunities for investors around the world, its rewards can take longer to pay off. The general consumer market has experienced a huge growth in the last decade, surpassing both the financial and manufacturing markets. Technology is no longer confined to the engineering and invention spheres. Nowadays, it is an inherent part of every other industry, ranging from health, finance, real estate, and manufacturing.<br> Tech spending totaled $3.3 trillion in 2019, according to data compiled by Statista. As well, the development of the digital age is associated with the most fundamental facet of the information age: The Internet. That means there are approximately 4.4 billion people on the internet. Almost 58% of the overall global population was accounted for by these figures. All of this said, it is not an exaggeration to say that it makes financial sense to invest in tech.<br>
